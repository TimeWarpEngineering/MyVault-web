# The Backlog

This is a text based system.  
For more sophisticated tools use VSTS.

All hierarchy of the process is just a folder.
If you need to group something for clarity add a folder.

[!include[New Items](New/NewIntroduction.md)]

[!include[Ready Items](Ready/ReadyIntroduction.md)]

### Iteration Items

This will be the items we are working on in this iteration/Sprint.
We will use a checklist in md somewhere to easily see what is done.
Do we really need to track in progress?  
If so we will adjust the process when needed.
