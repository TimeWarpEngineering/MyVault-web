## Things I need to talk to Steve about:

-[ ] What hosting model to use for the PWA for hosting on AWS
[based on the Blazor Docs](https://blazor.net/docs/host-and-deploy/index.html)

-[ ] What the best practice is to return a result of the changePin/changePassword methods from the edgeInterop to the C# side in order to populate an Alert or Text Box indicating success or failure before the redirect to the homepage

*  From what I can tell, the C# side is expecting an "EdgeAccountState" back, and I'm not sure how to pick that apart to determine the result of the changePIN/changePassword methods 

-[ ] Reviewing my PR's 

-[ ] Editing the build script to rebuild the js Distribution file.
  *  [here, in the csproj file](https://herculesone.visualstudio.com/Hercules/_git/HercPwa?path=%2FSource%2FHerc.Pwa.Js%2FHerc.Pwa.Js.csproj&version=GBRoundHouseEdit&_a=contents&line=72&lineStyle=plain&lineEnd=73&lineStartColumn=1&lineEndColumn=1)
        looks to be where the blazorHerc.js file is created and written into the dist directory. 
  *  Just did a build test and the blazorherc.js file was freshly created.
