## Busy Day of Talking

Discussed the path forward regarding our respective verticals with my immediate collegues. 

* Attempted to conditionally check if the ChangePW is successful or not. I feel there is something fundamental I am missing. 

Continued my asp.net core education.

###Needs:

*  To install the AWS MSVS extension I need admin priv. on the Azure repo.
*  One more meeting with Steve should do it.
