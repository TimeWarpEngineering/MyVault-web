### needs:
-[ ] adjust routing so the app opens up to the wallet
-[ ] comment out "Validate" in Sidebar

  ### Implementing Recent Trans List
  -[ ] Build EdgeTransaction UI Component
  -[ ] Build EdgeGetTransactions DTO, Action and Handler
  -[ ] Write unit tests

### wants
-[ ] Implement previous transaction list in the wallet component

### Completed
  * All necessarry branches merged
  * Front end details confirmed
  * Succesful Login/Logout and Change PW tests

### Blockers 
* Still struggling with the return from the ChangePin/PW methods
  * Have to roll with no Confirmation for the time being.
  *  I understand what needs to happen, I'm confused about where to look in the Edge Code to figure out what the error return would be, also where that return will come from, so for now, the ChangePin and ChangePW methods just redirect to the Homepage without a notification of success or failure.
