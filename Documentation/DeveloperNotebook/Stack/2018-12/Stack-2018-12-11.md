*  Figured out that the changePin method actually works, just not on the herstack account. 

* just decided to build a bootstrap style alert box for successful changePW/PIN operations then a redirect to homePage after ack.

@Stefan The return value is pin2Key, the per-device secret. I should probably fix the API not to return that.
The PIN and password recovery share similar logic, and for password recovery, thatâ€™s the thing you would put in the email.

To change the PIN, you need to be the account owner. Meaning, you have logged into the account using a password (not Edge login).
 I wonder if our web GUI has a bug where it allows you to change the PIN even for accounts that were edge logged in.
This might explain the behavior you were seeing with account1.
Changing the password should not break the PIN, unless the account was created in a really old Airbitz version.
```

from the Edge team. The hercstack account was created almost a year ago with an old web sdk version, during the transition of Airbitz to Edge. So the errant behavior is explained.
