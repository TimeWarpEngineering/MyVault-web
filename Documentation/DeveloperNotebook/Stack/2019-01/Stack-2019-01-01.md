## Week 1
##  Next Benchmark:
###  Jan 30, 2019 
## Todo:

*  [ ] Refactor balance formatter to handle negative numbers
*  [ ] Create and incorporate EdgeTransactionList Component
*  [ ]  `your wallet needs to have a "Top Up HERC" thing that directs the    user to https://purchase.herc.one/`  Add a link to this somewhere on the Wallet
    *  Need to find out if this is going to be opening the page outside of the app.
* `Allowing Denfeet access to the docs or provide a link or something, See the Discord conversation, So that we our making available the evidence of our constant progress.`
    *  I've discovered I was mistaken in thinking the toc.yaml files were autogenerated but I don't think it will take much to create them but automation should be thought of as a next step.  
 
### Completed

*  Updated Docs for the new Month/Year
*  Created Daily Doc Template
*  Researched DocFx

### Blockers
*  #### Issue

* #### Solution

### Notes: 
* Still struggling with the return from the ChangePin/PW methods
  * Have to roll with no Confirmation for the time being.
  *  I understand what needs to happen, I'm confused about where to look in the Edge Code to figure out what the error return would be, also where that return will come from, so for now, the ChangePin and ChangePW methods just redirect to the Homepage without a notification of success or failure. 
  *  As I further my understanding of the codebase I should have a solution to this built by the end of the month.
