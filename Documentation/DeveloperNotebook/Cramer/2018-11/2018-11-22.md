Working on lightouse improvments currenbt lighthouse version is Lighthouse 4.0.0-alpha.1

PWA score is 46 but we have solved many of these issues in other app so transering them her as appropriate.

going to do these one at a time.

 [x]- Add Theme

  The lighthouse error in the PWA Section is 

    Does not set an address-bar theme color
    Failures: No manifest was fetched, No `<meta name="theme-color">` tag found.

I added the Theme but actually adding and notice in the ligthouse report 4 the error changed but still exists.

[x]- Add Manifest

[x]- Add Service worker
    
    If you're building a Progressive Web App, consider using a service worker so that your app can work offline.

Moving the service worker from my proof of concept some time ago.
Frankly I don't remember much about this thing. Its not in Typescript.


[x]- Force https 

    Does not redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

    I have done this before but don't remember how exactly. A quick search and 
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio

    Updated that an cleaned up launch settings by deleting the IISExpress profile.

[x]- Add NoScript.

    Does not provide fallback content when JavaScript is not available
    The page body should render some content if its scripts are not available.
