Have spent last few hours working on updating the .editorConfig
there are many new features supported including naming conventions

Read the docs updated the files but now know about the
  Visual Studio IntelliCode - Preview

Trying to check it out and see how it also helps with consistent code 
and easier startup times for contributors.

Creating Application Get handler and test to get all the infrastructure in place.

Heavy usage of previous projects and Jimmy's Contoso Univ examples.
