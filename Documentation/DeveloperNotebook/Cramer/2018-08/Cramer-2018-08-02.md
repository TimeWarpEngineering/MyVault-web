So where was I... Read the Developer Noteback and yes now I remember.

Trying to create a service endpoint in VSTS.

Adding the Developer Notebook to DocFX.
Would be nice if one could just drag and drop a file to the toc 
and it would default create entry using file name as both name and href.

I have spent a bit of time to layout out a totally simplistic
Development process. Using folders and Markdown checklists.

I filed an issue last night with https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vsts-docs/issues/1442#event-1762472166
finally I got the powershell script to run and created the Service Endpoint.
