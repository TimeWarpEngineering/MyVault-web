Spent time 3:40 (helping Kevin this morning with LOJ)

First thing finish up the docs and deploy confirm CI/CD works as expected.

It deployed the docs only as designed with the path filters.

I have two proof of concept projects, 
one was to get PWA oriented stuff to meat lighthouse requirements.
The other was Edge UI login and the beginning of Assets models.

I need to prioritize this for this next iteration.

Also we will need at some point to actually style these 
according to the design comps.

Blazor State has not yet been updated to latest Blazor,
this to will need done soon.

Although I would like to do Edge UI first I have the feeling
that Blazor-State update will be required.

But PWA specific stuff we will push off until we have at least basic Assets functionality.

Css styling is highly subjective so that will come after the assets.

Add some tasks to the checklist. Based on the above thinking.

Blazor-State js stuff is outdated added task not sure if I have to fix it now.

Firing up Blazor-Herc Proof of concept app to compare 
and start moving into this app. 

The first thing I notice is that I don't have a Herc.Pwa.Js project for the typescript.

That is going to be needed for Edge Interop.

Before I do that I want to see if blazor state fails with 0.5.0 version of blazor

Confirmed that Blazor-State does need updated first. Dang.
