I tried to figure out how to manually create the App Registration in Azure.
Gave up and the script version was all I could get to work.

- [x] Configure Service Endpoint in VSTS to point to newly create Azure Endpoint

Set up a very basic CD for HercPwa
I thought yaml in the build was supposed to be out 
but couldn't see any indication.

- [x] Configure Continuous Deployment for App

- [ ] Configure Continuous Integration for Docs

Create yaml file in the Documentation folder
`.vsts-documentation.yml`

Copy what I have from Blazor-State project to start.

This version seems to both build and deploy.
need to split at some point as the deploy of docs should sync with 
deploy of app.

Also this deploys to github pages which won't work on a VSTS repo.

- [x] Create a new App Service in Azure for the docs.

Need to push this doc yaml up to test it.

Error:

```
.vsts-documentation.yml (Line: 16, Col: 3, Idx: 334) - (Line: 16, Col: 4, Idx: 335): While parsing a block mapping, did not find expected key.
```


Fixed that error and another.  
I updated the Release on Azure and now we have both sites deployed.
Next I need to add triggers to automate it.


### Pair with Kevin

2018-08-04 11:40:53 Kevin is screen sharing going to help him 
fix a bug with his Build.

2018-08-04 12:46:42 Done helping Kevin he has a working version deployed on azure.
Much still to do as it required a manual unzip but closer and bed time for him.
