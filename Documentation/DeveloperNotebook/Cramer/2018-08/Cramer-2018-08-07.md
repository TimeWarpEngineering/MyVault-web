## AssetDefintion Endpoint

Follow this to add Entity Framework.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/aspnetcore/new-db

commands are going to be done use dotnet ef
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet


We will be going with SQLServer localDB to start.

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```
Although we will be using Blazor for the UI we include scaffolding for now as it will generate razor views which may be of value when building the Blazor components.

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
```
in the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/aspnetcore/new-db#create-the-model)
they use Models folder but I think the term is confusing and over used.
Given we are using "Entity" Framework I call create and Entities folder.

Adding AutoMapper Nuget while at it 
```
dotnet add package AutoMapper
dotnet add package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

from Proof of concept BlazorHerc app:
* Update Entities 
* Update Startup
* Update Program.cs 
* Add appsettings with connection string.

```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --output-dir Data/Migrations
```

```
dotnet ef database update
```

I have added the most basic object the Application Object which is a singleton.
has Index feature to return the object.

need to write test for that endpoint.

Using Jimmy's Contoso deviating slightly to use fixie vs Xunit.
