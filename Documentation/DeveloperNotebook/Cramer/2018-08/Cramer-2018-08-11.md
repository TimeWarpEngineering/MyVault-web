Read yesterdays notes.

Todays Goals:

1. Finish the checklist for the Api Features.
2. Change to GUIDs vs int for Id.

Logan stated: "logo is required, either take picture or gallery"
for PWA I think the minimum then would be 

```html
<input type="file" accept="image/*">
```

How do we validate the uploaded image is an actual image.?

```csharp
 var img = System.Drawing.Image.FromStream(file.OpenReadStream());
```

Should we give a list of "avatar" images to select from?

Also need to look at blazor and how we do images there.

Looks like image upload is going to be a bit of a pain. I want to get something 
visible on the site ASAP.  So going to hold off on this and add a task.


Metrics

UnitofMeasure is not trivial either.

If we are going to be audit-able then Units of Measure are important.

Going with basic for now need to revisit later.
