Last couple of days have been doing much css styling and slacked on my dev notebook.

- [x] add favicon.  
     There is more to this than meets the eye.  Need to test on many platforms and seleinum can't test it. 
     https://realfavicongenerator.net/blog/favicon-why-youre-doing-it-wrong/
     using the basic for now.
     ```html
     <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico">
     ```
- [x] Remove diagnostic colors from Header.
    I spent too much time trying to find decent color schemes.

- [x] Do NOT show the Search Bar for now.
- [x] When login screen is displayed the background should be unclickable
- [x] Update Edge Login with Herc Logo and Company Name "Hercules"
- [ ] Change Header first Lorem Ipsum to have Local Time
      Why?  Every computer or smart phone has localtime.
- [ ] Remove second Lorem Ipsum
- [ ] Make page responsive to work on IPhone
    - First lets just shut off stuff

- [ ] Blazor-State needs to subscribe components the states they use so when the state changes we can call back StateHasChanged
- [ ] Add Logout button.
