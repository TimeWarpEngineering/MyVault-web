It's been a while need to refresh myself with the repo.

Create new itteration and updated the Checklist for it.

Decomposing the screen into components and working just on visual stuff now.

A little investitation to how I want to attempt to style these thing.  
There is no css in C# yet that I know of.

Leaning toward inline style tags right in the component.

```
<style>
  #Store { background-color:red; }
  #Hipr { background-color: purple; }
  #BlockChain { background-color: pink; }
</style>
```

I am not a big fan of css frankly.  One giant global variable.
